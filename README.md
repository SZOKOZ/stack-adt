**Supported Languages:**
- Java (developed in NetBeans)
- Lua (developed in Sublime Text)
- C (developed in Code::Blocks)

**Planned Languages:**

# About the Stack
The Stack is an abstract data type that collects elements in a lingear order with two primary operations, push() and pop(). Elements are pushed onto the Stack and can only be popped out of the Stack in the reverse order in which they were added. This is called LIFO (last in, first out) ordering. Other operations peek() or top() may be used to see if the Stack is empty by checking to see if the top element of the Stack is empty.
